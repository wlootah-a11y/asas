"""asas-workflow.

Contract rows: **Schema** (``migrate``), **Seeding**
(``seed_workflow_definitions``).

This module owns the **escalation composition** — the reference host's clearest
demonstration that some features exist only *between* packages:

    asas-workflow      owns the definition and the instance lifecycle
    asas-access        supplies the CHANGE_APPROVER principal
    asas-notifications tells the approver, and tells the requester the verdict

Not one of the three can see the composition from inside itself. Workflow does
not know what a "support lead" is; access does not know an approval exists;
notifications does not know why it is sending. The host is where the feature
lives, and this file is that host's stitching — Teamy's equivalent is
``changecontrol_wiring.py``.

The trap: a definition is **data**, seeded into the database, and the seeded
copy is what runs. Editing ``ESCALATION`` below and restarting does not change
an already-seeded definition — ``ensure_definition`` is keyed on the definition
key and will not silently rewrite a version that live instances are bound to.
Versioning a live process is a deliberate act, not a redeploy.
