"""asas-jobs.

Contract rows: **Schema** (``migrate``), **Seeding** (``ensure_schedule``),
**Host hooks** (``configure_context_binder``, ``configure_runner``).

Also one third of the **async-notification composition**: jobs supplies the
*when*, notifications the *what*. Neither package imports the other — the host
is the only place they meet, which is exactly why no per-package README can
teach this.

**Delivery is at-least-once, so handlers must be idempotent.** That is not a
caveat, it is the design: crash recovery re-runs a job whose lease expired, and
a handler that cannot tolerate a second run will corrupt data the first time a
process dies mid-work.

The rule this replaces: any new async or periodic work is a handler here plus an
``enqueue`` or ``ensure_schedule`` call. Never a ``BackgroundTasks``, never an
``after_commit`` hook, never a sweep at boot — those all lose the work when the
process dies, which is the failure this package exists to remove.

    Single-tenant here, so there is nothing to bind and the body is empty; the
    hook is still installed, because the *shape* is the thing worth showing.

    The runner calls ``fn(session, org_id)`` — and only for jobs that *carry*
    an org, which is how a wrong signature here once survived the whole suite:
    hand-enqueued test jobs are org-less and skip the binder, while every

    **Idempotence has to be designed; it is not a property of "the query looks
    read-only".** The obvious version of this handler — select the overdue
    tickets, notify each — is *not* idempotent: delivery is at-least-once, so a
    lease that lapses mid-run means the next attempt notifies everyone a second
    time. Nothing about the select prevents that.

    A read-then-write check — "has this already been notified?" — is **not**
    enough, and that is the trap worth seeing. Two sweeps overlap whenever a
    lease is reclaimed while the original run is still working, and both can
    read *no* before either writes.

    So the claim is a **uniqueness constraint**, not a query: each ticket's
    breach inserts one `SlaNotice` row, and the database lets exactly one
    concurrent sweep win. Idempotence is designed, and the cheapest correct
    design is usually a constraint rather than a check.

    (``notify(coalesce_unread=True)`` is the package's own answer to the same
    problem, but it only engages when the kind has no delivery channels — this
    kind has one, so it would silently not apply. Worth knowing before reaching
    for it.)
