Contract rows: **Routers** (``build_router``), **Schema** (``migrate``),
**Seeding** (the topic vocabulary), **Host hooks**
(``configure_context_resolver``, ``configure_recipient_filter``).

Also one third of the **escalation composition** (see ``workflow.py``): this
package supplies the *telling*, and knows nothing about approvals.

The recipient filter is the part worth reading twice. A notification is a
**copy** of a fact, made at send time — so if the subject record is restricted,
filtering has to happen *before* the row is written. There is no redaction pass
afterwards, because by then the title is already sitting in someone's inbox.
That is the same rule search has about never indexing restricted fields, and for
the same reason.
