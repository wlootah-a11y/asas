"""DO NOT COPY THIS FILE. It is not authentication.

=============================================================================
This is a static token→row lookup with no secret, no expiry, no revocation,
no rotation, no hashing, and no rate limiting. Tokens are hardcoded in the
source. Anyone holding this file holds every account.

It exists so the reference host can demonstrate the *composition seam*, and
for no other reason. Authentication is deliberately NOT an Asas package
(design record 0030 §4): it is the one concern where every host differs and
where a shared implementation would be actively harmful.

If you are adopting Asas: delete this file and use your own
``get_current_user``. The only thing worth copying is the shape — a callable
that returns your user object, wired in the three places marked below.
=============================================================================

Demonstrates: the **auth composition seam**, which has no worked example
anywhere else. Four things a host must supply, and where they land:

1. ``get_current_user`` — your dependency. Asas packages never learn how it
   works; they receive the resolved object and ask the access package about it.
2. **Guards at include time** — routers come back from ``build_routers`` /
   ``build_router`` unguarded, and the host applies its own dependencies when
   including them. See ``main.py``.
3. ``configure_org_resolver`` — tenancy is a host concept. See
   ``wiring/lookups.py``.
4. **The request actor, reachable from a session** — hooks like notifications'
   context resolver are handed only the session, so ``get_current_user``
   stashes the resolved actor on ``session.info`` (see below, and
   ``wiring/notifications.py``).

The module refuses to arm without ``ENABLE_FAKE_AUTH=1`` so that a host which
copied it by accident fails closed on its first request rather than shipping
with a public back door.
