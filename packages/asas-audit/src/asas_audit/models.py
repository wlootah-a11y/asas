"""The one table. Append-only, hash-chained, tenant-scoped.

**Identity is opaque strings, deliberately.** ``org_id`` and ``resource_id`` are
``str``, not ``int``, because a host that keys tenants by UUID and one that keys
them by integer must both be able to adopt this without a fork. The chain payload
stringifies every field anyway (see :mod:`asas_audit.chain`), so there is nothing
to gain from a narrower column and a whole class of adoption problem to lose. No
FKs to host tables either, for the same reason the rest of the family has none.

Two identity columns, and they answer different questions:

* ``seq`` is the **chain order**, a database-assigned integer. Verification walks
  rows in ``seq`` order, so it has to come from the database rather than from the
  application, and it has to be monotonic.
* ``id`` is the **event identity**, a UUID string, which is what a host puts in a
  URL or hands to a support ticket. It is also what goes into the hash, so the
  fingerprint does not depend on the sequence number the database happened to
  assign.

``occurred_at`` is when the business action happened, which is not always when the
row was written: a queued job records an event that occurred earlier. It is part
of the hash, so it cannot be corrected after the fact, which is the point.
