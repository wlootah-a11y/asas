"""Hash-chain primitives. Pure: no database, no session, unit-testable.

Each entry carries the fingerprint of the one before it, so the log is a chain
and any alteration to a link shows up as a divergence from that point on. Three
kinds of tampering are detectable and all three matter: an entry that was
**edited**, an entry that was **deleted**, and an entry **inserted** after the
fact to look original.

**The writer and the verifier share one canonical encoding, which is why they
live in one file.** Two encodings is how a chain reports breaks that are not
there, and a tamper-evidence tool that cries wolf gets switched off, which is
strictly worse than not having one. So this module owns the exact dict that gets
hashed (:func:`chain_payload`), the exact bytes it becomes
(:func:`canonical_bytes`), and both sides of the arithmetic. Nothing else in the
package, and nothing in a host, may compose either.

    hash_current = sha256(hash_prev || canonical_json(chain_payload))

On verify the payload is rebuilt from the stored columns, so a row that was
changed in place no longer hashes to what it says it does.
