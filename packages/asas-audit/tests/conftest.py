"""Standalone package fixtures.

Engine: SQLite temp file by default; Postgres when ``TEST_DATABASE_URL`` is set
(the CI matrix runs both). Schema always comes from the package's own migration
chain via ``migrate(engine)``, so the chain is exercised on every run.

Two guards, because two of this package's three guarantees can only be checked on
Postgres and would otherwise pass for the wrong reason:

* ``requires_postgres`` for the trigger and the advisory lock, which SQLite has
  neither of;
* ``requires_enforcement`` for the isolation assertions, because a superuser
  ignores row-level security with FORCE set. It honours ``ASAS_REQUIRE_RLS``:
  skip locally where a bypassing role is a deliberate convenience, fail in CI
  where it means the coverage silently stopped running.
