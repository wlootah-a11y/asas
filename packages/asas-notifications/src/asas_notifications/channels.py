"""Channel adapters — the house provider pattern (cf. ``services/linkedin/``):
adding a channel = one adapter class + one ``register_adapter`` call, no caller
changes. Adapters are channel-specific formatters/senders; the payload they get is
channel-agnostic (title/body/link + taxonomy), per the epic's renderer rule.

WXL-222 ships the protocol + registry; the real email adapter lands with WXL-225.
