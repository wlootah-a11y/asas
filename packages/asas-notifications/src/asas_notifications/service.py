"""Emitter seam + routing policy + dispatcher (WXL-222; DR 0003).

- Producers call ``notify`` inside their own transaction — the insert IS the
  enqueue — passing the **application action** that caused the emit and the
  three axes (topic/nature/urgency). No registration: the action is a
  reference, not a declaration; ``register_kind`` survives one release as a
  deprecating shim (DR 0003 I-3).
- Routing resolves per channel, most specific wins: topic policy row → axis
  policy row → the built-in fallback, which is exactly the pre-0.16 rule —
  ``low`` is in-app only (ambient activity never emails you — the epic's KPI),
  ``normal``/``high`` add an email delivery row. Empty policy tables therefore
  reproduce 0.15 behavior bit-for-bit (the DR's equivalence guarantee).
  ``in_app`` is the notification row itself; a policy that disables it for an
  emit suppresses the whole insert (no row, no anchor for deliveries).
- The dispatcher is queue-shaped but v1-simple: an after-commit hook plus a
  startup/periodic sweep (same self-heal pattern as ``search/semantic.py``), core
  SQL only (an ORM session inside ``after_commit`` would re-fire the hook). Send
  failures never fail the producing transaction; a real worker can replace this
  later with zero schema change.

    else. ``None`` marks an ad hoc one-off, which never coalesces. The four

    emits land in the seeded ``general`` topic) and must exist in
    ``notification_topic`` — the one fail-loud reference, because policy and
    preferences key on it. Channels come from :func:`resolve_channels`; when
    policy disables ``in_app`` for this emit nothing is inserted at all (the
    row is both the feed entry and the anchor for delivery rows).

    ``template=`` and ``data=`` are stored for U-4's renderer (and a possible
    read-time feed renderer later); ``title`` remains required until then.

    - Actor exclusion is built in: ``actor_user_id`` never notifies itself.
    - Notifications are tenant-owned: ``org_id`` is stamped from the explicit
      parameter, else the context resolver; with neither, ``ValueError`` at the
      emit site — background producers acting *for* a tenant pass the org
      explicitly (DR 0001 T4/T7).
    - **Whenever ``entity_type`` is given**, recipients run through the configured
      visibility filter — a notification must never leak a private record (the
      search-index rule). ``record`` is passed to the filter when the producer
      has it and is ``None`` otherwise; the filter always receives ``entity_id``
      and decides.
    - ``coalesce_unread`` (TEAMY-298): an UNREAD row for the same (org,
      recipient, action, entity) is updated in place — title/body replaced
      (``merge_body(old, new)`` when given), latest ``data`` wins, ``created_at``
      refreshed — instead of inserting, so an edit burst stays one live bell
      entry. Only ambient emits coalesce: it requires an action and an entity
      key and is ignored whenever the emit routes to external channels, and
      read **or archived** rows are never rewritten.

    The caller owns the commit — the insert rides the producing transaction, so a
