"""Asas access control — configuration-driven permissions over one principal layer.

Extracted from Teamy (epic WXL-112, actions TEAMY-452, groups TEAMY-453;
extraction epic TEAMY-466, design record 0017). Three concerns:

* **Field permissions** — which *principals* may view/edit each field of an entity
  type, stored as data in ``field_permission``.
* **Action permissions** — which principals may perform org-wide action verbs
  (``team.create``, ``audit.view``, …), stored as data in ``action_permission``.
* **Record visibility** — public/private records with registered private viewers.

A **principal** is a role tier (``admin``/``member``/``viewer``), a group key
(org-wide functional bundle; membership resolved query-time via a host-registered
global source), or a relationship resolved per (user, record) (``self``,
``supervisor``, ``team_*``, …). Hosts register resolvers/sources/fields/verbs at
boot — the package never imports host models.

Semantics are safe-by-default: a field with no policy rows keeps the caller's
baseline rule (this engine returns "allowed"); an unconfigured verb is admin-only;
``admin`` is always allowed (the implicit floor); only an *actual* change to a
restricted field is rejected.

Host contract (table-owning variant): :func:`migrate` (package Alembic chain,
adopt-or-create), the ``register_*``/``reserve_principals`` hooks, and
:func:`seed_field_permissions` / :func:`seed_action_permissions` taking the
host's policy data (grant defaults live host-side, like validation rule
catalogs). Enforcement on/off is the caller's concern throughout.
