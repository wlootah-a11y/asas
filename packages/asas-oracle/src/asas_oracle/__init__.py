"""Asas Oracle Fusion HCM: an async REST client for Oracle Fusion, with the
instance's traps written down once.

Domain-agnostic: it knows Fusion (the query grammar, the media types, the
limits, the HCM reference data every product resolves ids against) and nothing
about what a product does with it. Recruiting, core HR, absence or payroll
integrations all build on the same client; which resources a product reads,
what a row means and which of them it caches are the product's.

Public surface: a **table-less, router-less** package that fills none of the
four host-contract slots. Everything is an object the host constructs:

- :class:`OracleSettings`: base URL, Basic credentials, timeout, optional
  gateway API key. An empty base URL means "Oracle is off here".
- :class:`OracleFusionClient`: ``get`` / ``get_collection`` /
  ``iter_collection`` / ``get_bytes`` / ``post`` / ``patch``, read-through
  cached per a :class:`CachePolicy` over a :class:`Cache`
  (:class:`MemoryCache` by default, :class:`NullCache` to turn it off).
- :class:`OracleLookups`: id-to-name lookups (:data:`NAME_LOOKUPS`), people by
  person id, positions with their budget flag, a worker by email address and
  their department, and a reference set's departments. Optionally backed by a
  :class:`LookupStore` shared across processes (stale answers served and
  refreshed behind the caller, negative answers kept);
  :class:`MemoryLookupStore` is the in-process one.
- Credentials as a seam (:class:`Auth`): :class:`BasicAuth`,
  :class:`ApiKeyAuth`, :class:`BearerToken`, :class:`OAuthClientCredentials`
  (a cached, refreshed client-credentials token) and :class:`CompositeAuth`;
  :meth:`OracleSettings.auth` builds the right one from the settings.
- Upstream health: circuit breakers per resource plus one for the host
  (:class:`BreakerPolicy`, counting only real outages, :func:`is_outage`)
  that make reads fail fast with :class:`OracleUnavailableError`,
  per-resource statistics (``client.health.snapshot()``), an ``on_request``
  hook (:class:`RequestEvent`) for a host's own metrics, and
  :func:`count_calls` for the Oracle requests one host request made.
- ``client.request(...)``: the one public building block every verb uses, for
  what the verbs do not cover.
- :mod:`asas_oracle.check` (``asas-oracle-check``): each read a deployment
  depends on called once, from a manifest of :class:`Probe` s, for verifying a
  gateway registration (the HCM reference reads by default).
- ``query``: the ``q`` grammar (:func:`eq`, :func:`like`, :func:`and_`,
  :func:`and_words` for the resources that refuse ``;``,
  :func:`literal`) and row readers (:func:`text`, :func:`flag`,
  :func:`integer`, :func:`child_items`).
- Fusion's paging limits and attachments, on any resource:
  :func:`capped_page` (the page cap and the offset ceiling),
  :func:`attachments`, :func:`enclosure_key`, :func:`download_enclosure`.
- Errors: :class:`OracleError` > :class:`OracleConfigError`,
  :class:`OracleNotConfiguredError`, :class:`OracleUpstreamError` >
  :class:`OracleNotFoundError`, :class:`OracleAlreadyExistsError`,
  :class:`OracleAuthError`, :class:`OracleUnavailableError`, and
  :class:`OracleQueryError` for a value the ``q`` grammar cannot carry.

#: The request header some resources need before they will answer a query at

#: error, so a missing header reads as "there is nothing there": measured on a
#: live pod, the same two-clause filter on ``/positions`` returns 33,391 rows
#: with it and ZERO without. Pass it as ``headers`` to
#: :meth:`OracleHcmClient.get`; it joins the cache key, so a v1 body is never
