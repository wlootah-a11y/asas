"""The HTTP layer: one async client per Oracle Fusion instance.

Worth knowing about the upstream:

- ``onlyData=true`` strips the HATEOAS ``links`` block, which triples a
  payload. Every read sets it; a caller that needs the links (an attachment's
  enclosure key lives only there) passes ``onlyData="false"``.
- A field list NARROWS the response. Ask for no projection and a record comes
  back with the NAMES Fusion denormalises beside its ids (a ``PhaseName``
  beside a ``PhaseId``); ask for ``fields=...PhaseId`` and the names are
  dropped, leaving bare ids that no lookup resource resolves.
- A PATCH wants ``application/vnd.oracle.adf.resourceitem+json`` and refuses
  plain JSON; a POST wants plain JSON and refuses the ADF type.
- A duplicate key on a create comes back as a 400 with prose, not a 409, so the
  status alone cannot tell it apart (see :class:`OracleAlreadyExistsError`).

**No retries here.** Whether and when to retry is the caller's policy: an
outbox row counts its own attempts, and a second retry budget inside the client
would be invisible to it. The one exception is a connection that could not be
OPENED (``OracleSettings.connect_retries``), which sent nothing and so cannot
be a duplicate. A PATCH by id is idempotent (the same body twice
leaves the record where once did) and so is safe for a caller to retry; a
state TRANSITION endpoint such as ``POST .../action/move`` is not, because a
repeat advances the record again.

**Circuit breakers guard the reads**, one per resource plus one for the host
(:class:`asas_oracle.BreakerPolicy`): after consecutive outages they fail
at once with :class:`OracleUnavailableError` instead of each waiting out the
timeout. Writes are counted, never refused.
:attr:`OracleFusionClient.health` carries the breaker and per-resource call
statistics for a status page.

        ``None`` values in ``params`` are dropped. Read-through cached per the
        :class:`CachePolicy`; a cache miss or a failing cache falls through to
        Oracle unchanged.

        ``use_cache=False`` goes to Oracle whatever the cache holds and stores
        nothing. Use it when a layer ABOVE the client (a persistent lookup
        store, a mirror) has decided its own answer is out of date: a cached
        copy of the same read is no newer, and answering from it would re-save
        the old answer as fresh.

        ``headers`` are extra request headers for this ONE read, and they join
        the cache key. They exist for ``REST-Framework-Version: 2``, which some
        resources need to answer a query at all: without it Fusion answers
        **200 with an empty collection** rather than an error, so a missing
        header reads as "there is nothing there". Measured on a live pod: the
        same two-clause filter on ``/positions`` returns 33,391 rows under
        version 2 and ZERO under the default version 1."""
