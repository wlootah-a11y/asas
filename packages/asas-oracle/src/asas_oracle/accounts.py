"""A person's Oracle USER ACCOUNT, and whether it holds a security role.

The question a host asks before letting somebody do something Fusion itself
reserves: "does this person hold role X in Oracle". It is a read of
``/userAccounts`` and its ``userAccountRoles`` child, and it is here rather
than in a host because nothing about it is domain specific: which codes
count is the caller's, the way to ask is Oracle's.

**THE ADDRESS IS THE JOIN.** Nothing carries both a host's own account id and
Oracle's, so an email address is the only fact both systems hold about the
same human. Two routes to the account, cheapest first: ``Username`` (which on
many instances IS the address), then the worker's ``WorkEmail`` to a
``PersonId`` and the account from that.

**A NON-PRODUCTION POD SCRUBS THE USERNAME.** On one measured pod, 1,874 of a
2,000-account sample had a fixed suffix appended after the domain. So a
caller may name that suffix, and the suffixed spellings are tried FIRST,
because on such a pod they are the likely ones. See :func:`usernames_for`.

**ONE EQUALITY PER ROLE CODE, never one query for all of them**, and this is
the trap worth keeping: under Oracle's DEFAULT REST framework version,
``RoleCode IN (a,b)`` matches NOTHING and ``a or b`` honours ``a`` alone.
Neither is refused. Both answer an ordinary 200 with a page that looks
empty, so a person who holds the role reads as not holding it, and a
permission check fails in the SAFE-LOOKING direction while being wrong.
``expand=userAccountRoles`` is no way round it either: before framework
version 3 it stops at 25 children and says nothing about having done so (29
roles held, 25 returned).

Sending ``REST-Framework-Version: 2`` would allow a single query, and
:data:`~asas_oracle.REST_FRAMEWORK_V2` is there for a caller who has
checked that every hop forwards it. An API gateway in the middle may not,
and an unforwarded header fails the same silent way, so the version 1 form
is what this module uses: it is correct on every route.

**FAIL CLOSED IS THE CALLER'S JOB, NOT THIS MODULE'S.** `holds_any_role`
answers True or False for a question Oracle answered, and RAISES when Oracle
could not be asked. A caller must not read the raise as "no": a permission
rule that treats an unreachable Oracle as a refusal is right, and one that
treats it as a pass is a hole, but either way the decision belongs to the
rule and not to the read.
