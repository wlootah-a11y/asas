"""Resolve which per-package Asas tag `asas add`/`asas new` pin generated
dependency strings to, when the caller doesn't pass an explicit version.

Since `RELEASING.md` (2026-08-25) each package tags **independently** —
`asas-<pkg>/vX.Y.Z` — there is no repo-wide tag to resolve against anymore.
The old flat `vX.Y.Z` scheme is retired (kept only for decoding old pins);
every function here is scoped to one dist name at a time, batched into a
single remote round trip when resolving several."""

# checklist, and tests/test_version_consistency.py at the repo root fails if
# an entry disagrees with that package's pyproject.toml. Used only as a last
# resort — offline, no git on PATH, or the remote is unreachable — so
# `asas add`/`asas new` still work without a network, just possibly pinned to
# a tag that's no longer that package's newest. An explicit --version always
# wins over both this and live discovery.
