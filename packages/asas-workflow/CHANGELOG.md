# Changelog — `asas-workflow`

Versions follow semver, and the git tag matches this file: `asas-workflow/v0.11.2`.
Pre-1.0, a breaking change bumps the **minor**.

Release procedure and the historical tag mapping: [`RELEASING.md`](../../RELEASING.md).

## 0.11.3 — 2026-10-02

- **Requires `sqlmodel<0.0.45`.** From 0.0.45, SQLModel's `DateTime` refuses a
  datetime without a timezone, and this package stores naive UTC, so every
  write of a timestamp failed on a fresh install. Nothing changes for a host
  already on 0.0.44 or earlier. Moving the columns to timezone-aware values,
  which lifts the cap, is a separate change.

## 0.11.2 — 2026-08-27

- Added a test for the end-node `config["outcome"]` check. It was filed as a missing validation and is not one: `validate_definition` has always rejected an end node without an outcome — the check simply had no test, and a second copy of it was briefly added before review caught the duplicate. **No behaviour change** (Teamy TEAMY-808).
- `REJECTED_OUTCOME` is now exported. Hosts comparing `instance.outcome` had to restate the literal `"rejected"`, where a typo silently reads every rejection as an approval (Teamy TEAMY-808).
- Documented two contracts that existed only in the engine's internals: a completion callback **runs inside the engine's transaction and must not commit** (committing discards the rollback-on-failure guarantee it exists to provide), and `final_decision_of` returns `(actor_id, comment)` — **not** the completion outcome, which is what settles how an instance ended and reaches the callback as its third argument (Teamy TEAMY-808).

## 0.11.1 — 2026-08-27

- **The org axis now reaches the approver floor** (issue #31, audit defect
  T-4). `ProcessInstance.org_id` existed but `open_instance` had no way to set
  it, so both `resolve_floor(session, instance.org_id)` call sites always
  resolved the unscoped floor — the floor exists precisely so one org's
  approvals never land in another org's inboxes. `open_instance` gains an
  `org_id=` parameter, with a new `configure_org_resolver` hook (the DR 0001
  T2 resolver shape) as fallback; `None` stays a real platform scope.
  Additive — existing callers are unchanged.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-08-25

- **Breaking:** `asas_workflow.seed` (the module) is now `asas_workflow.seeding`. The old name shadowed the seeding callable, so `asas_workflow.seed(session)` — what the README documented — raised `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`. Import `seed_workflow_definitions` from the package.
- Declares `__all__` (54 names). It was the only package without one, so `import *` leaked every transitively-imported name.
- **Adoption is now shape-verified.** `migrate()` previously decided adopt-vs-create on the sentinel table's *name* alone, so a host that already owned a table of that name had the baseline stamped as applied and skipped entirely — silently, and unrepairable by re-running. It now requires every baseline table to be present and the sentinel to carry the baseline's columns, and raises with the table, the package and the remedy otherwise (Teamy TEAMY-795).
- Licensed under **Apache 2.0** (was proprietary/all-rights-reserved). `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` ship inside the wheel and the metadata carries `License-Expression: Apache-2.0` (Teamy TEAMY-797).
- Added `tests/test_host_contract.py`: `__all__` declared and resolving, contract names callable rather than shadowed by a submodule, module exports declared deliberately (Teamy TEAMY-798).

## Before 2026-08-25

Earlier releases were cut as **repo-wide** tags (`v0.1.0` … `v0.15.0`) under the
lockstep scheme in DR 0017, which decayed: from `v0.11.0` onward the repo tag no
longer matched any package's own version, so `asas-workflow @ v0.15.0` did not install
`asas-workflow` 0.15.0. `RELEASING.md` carries the full tag-to-version table for
decoding an old pin. Individual changes are in the git history.
